///BANK STORY

//Alex Random goes to the bankOfBen to open an account and deposit $99

addAccount('Alex Random',99,bankOfBen);

// The bank confirms that Alex's account has succesfully loaded into their system

console.log(bankOfBen);

//Alex goes to the casino and wins $500 and decides to deposit that money into his account through the ATM

console.log(deposit(bankOfBen,'Alex Random',500))

// While he is waiting in the line he hears a man getting very angry trying to make a deposit, because he is old 
// and has gone to the wrong bank

console.log(deposit(bankOfBen,'Old Man',10))

// A criminal now goes up to the ATM and tries to withdraw money from Bill Gates account

console.log(withdraw(bankOfBen, 'Bill Gates', 50000));

// Now Alex is back at the bank and wants to withdraw money to pay his rent, his rent is $1000

console.log(withdraw(bankOfBen, 'Alex Random', 1000))

// He see's that he can only withdraw $599 so he does that;

console.log(withdraw(bankOfBen, 'Alex Random', 599))

// The bank is now closing and wants to know how much money they have, so runs a sum check
