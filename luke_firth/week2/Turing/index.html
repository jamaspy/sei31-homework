  <h2>Who Was Alan Turing?</h2>
<p>Alan Turing is often called the father of modern computing.
  He was a brilliant mathematician and logician.
  He developed the idea of the modern computer and artificial intelligence.
</p>
<p>
  Born in London in 1912,
  Alan Turing attended Sherborne School in Dorset and then, later,
  King's College Cambridge and Princeton University in the USA.

<p>
  At the outbreak of World War Two,
  Alan joined the Government Codes and Cypher School at Bletchley Park.
  He worked on breaking the code for the German enciphering machine,
  a device for sending coded messages to units of the German forces.
  Alan developed a machine (the Bombe) which helped break the code.
  He also went on to break the Naval Enigma, an even more complicated machine.
  His wartime services helped to win the war,
  but his work was so secret that very few people were aware of the importance

About Turing**Christopher, Alans first love, Christophers death spured
Turing to pursue mathematics in the hope that he could
understand wether a part of Chrisopher could somehow live on
without his body. In the year after his death, Turing wrote an essay
in which he discussed how the soul might survive after death with a nod
to the new field of quantum mechanics

**Riveting Facts Page
1. HE’S THE FATHER OF MODERN COMPUTER SCIENCE.
Turing essentially pioneered the idea of computer memory. In 1936,
Turing published a seminal paper called “On Computable Numbers” [PDF],
which The Washington Post has called “the founding document of the computer age.”
In the philosophical article, he hypothesized that one day,
we could build machines that could compute any problem that a human could,
using 0s and 1s. Turing proposed single-task machines called Turing machines that
would be capable of solving just one type of math problem,
but a “universal computer” would be able to tackle any kind of problem thrown at
it by storing instructional code in the computer’s memory.
Turing’s ideas about memory storage and using a single machine to carry out all
tasks laid the foundation for what would become the digital computer.

In 1945, while working for the UK’s National Physical Laboratory,
he came up with the Automatic Computing Machine, the first digital
computer with stored programs.
Previous computers didn’t have electric memory storage, and had to
be manually rewired to switch between different programs.

2. HE PLAYED A HUGE ROLE IN WINNING WORLD WAR II.
Turing began working at Bletchley Park, Britain’s secret headquarters
for its codebreakers during World War II,
in 1939. By one estimate, his work there may have cut the war short
by up to two years. He’s credited with saving millions of lives.

Turing immediately got to work designing a codebreaking machine
called the Bombe (an update of a previous Polish machine)
with the help of his colleague Gordon Welchman. The Bombe
shortened the steps required in decoding,
and 200 of them were built for British use over the course of the war.
They allowed codebreakers to decipher up to 4000 messages a day.

His greatest achievement was cracking the Enigma, a mechanical
device used by the German army to encode secure messages.
It proved nearly impossible to decrypt without the correct cipher,
which the German forces changed every day.
Turing worked to decipher German naval communications at a
point when German U-boats were
sinking ships carrying vital supplies across the Atlantic between Allied nations.
In 1941, Turing and his team managed to decode the German Enigma messages,
helping to steer Allied ships away from the German submarine attacks.
In 1942, he traveled to the U.S. to help the Americans with their own codebreaking work.

3. HE BROKE THE RULES TO WRITE TO CHURCHILL.
Early on, Bletchley Park’s operations were hampered by a lack of resources,
but pleas for better staffing were ignored by government officials. So, Alan Turing and several other codebreakers at Bletchley Park went over
their heads to write directly to Prime Minister Winston Churchill.
One of the codebreakers from Bletchley Park delivered the letter by hand in October 1941.

“Our reason for writing to you direct is that for months we have done everything
that we possibly can through the normal channels, and that we despair of any early
improvement without your intervention,” they wrote to Churchill [PDF]. “No doubt in
the long run these particular requirements will be met, but meanwhile still more
precious months will have been wasted, and as our needs are continually expanding
we see little hope of ever being adequately staffed.”
In response, Churchill immediately fired off a missive to his chief of staff:
“Make sure they have all they want on extreme priority and report to me that this had been done.”
4. HE HAD SOME ODD HABITS.
Like many geniuses, Turing was not without his eccentricities.
He wore a gas mask while riding his bike to combat his allergies.
Instead of fixing his bike’s faulty chain, he learned exactly when to dismount to
secure it in place before it slipped off. He was known around Bletchley Park for
chaining his tea mug to a radiator to prevent it from being taken by other staffers.

5. HE RODE HIS BIKE 60 MILES TO GET TO THE FIRST DAY OF SCHOOL.
Though he was considered an average student, Turing was dedicated enough to his
schooling that when a general strike prevented him from taking the train to his
first day at his new elite boarding school, the 14-year-old rode his bike the 62 miles instead.

6. HE TRIED OUT FOR THE OLYMPICS.
Turing started running as a schoolboy and continued throughout his life,
regularly running the 31 miles between Cambridge and Ely while he was a
fellow at King’s College. During World War II, he occasionally ran the 40
miles between London and Bletchley Park for meetings.
He almost became an Olympic athlete, too. He came in fifth place at a qualifying
marathon for the 1948 Olympics with a 2-hour, 46-minute finish (11 minutes slower
than the 1948 Olympic marathon winner). However, a leg injury held back his athletic ambitions that year.
Afterward, he continued running for the Walton Athletic Club, though, and
served as its vice president. ”I have such a stressful job that the only way
I can get it out of my mind is by running hard,” he once told the club’s secretary.
“It's the only way I can get some release."

7. HE WAS PROSECUTED FOR BEING GAY.
In 1952, Turing was arrested after reporting a burglary in his home. In the
course of the investigation, the police discovered Turing’s relationship with
another man, Arnold Murray. Homosexual relationships were illegal in the UK
at the time, and he was charged with “gross indecency.” He pled guilty on
the advice of his lawyer, and opted to undergo chemical castration instead
of serving time in jail.
8. THE GOVERNMENT ONLY RECENTLY APOLOGIZED FOR HIS CONVICTION …
In 2009, UK Prime Minister Gordon Brown issued a public apology to Turing on
behalf of the British government. “Alan and the many thousands of other gay men
 who were convicted as he was convicted under homophobic laws were treated terribly,
 ” Brown said. "This recognition of Alan's status as one of Britain's most famous
victims of homophobia is another step towards equality and long overdue."
Acknowledging Britain’s debt to Turing for his vital contributions to the
war effort, he announced, “on behalf of the British government, and all those
who live freely thanks to Alan's work I am very proud to say: we're sorry,
you deserved so much better."

His conviction was not actually pardoned, though, until 2013, when he received
a rare royal pardon from the Queen of England.

9. … AND NAMED A LAW AFTER HIM.
Turing was only one of the many men who suffered after being prosecuted for
their homosexuality under 19th-century British indecency laws. Homosexuality
was decriminalized in the UK in 1967, but the previous convictions were never
overturned. Turing’s Law, which went into effect in 2017, posthumously pardoned
men who had been convicted for having consensual gay sex before the repeal.
According to one of the activists who campaigned for the mass pardons, around
15,000 of the 65,000 gay men convicted under the outdated law are still alive.

10. HE POISONED HIMSELF … MAYBE.
There is still a bit of mystery surrounding Turing’s death at the age of 41. Turing
died of cyanide poisoning, in what is widely believed to have been a suicide. Turing’s
life had been turned upside down by his arrest. He lost his job and his security clearance.
By order of the court, he had to take hormones intended to “cure” his homosexuality, which
caused him to grow breasts and made him impotent. But not everyone is convinced that he died by suicide.

In 2012, Jack Copeland, a Turing scholar, argued that the evidence used to declare
Turing’s death a suicide in 1954 would not be sufficient to close the case today.
The half-eaten apple by his bedside, thought to be the source of his poisoning,
was never tested for cyanide. There was still a to-do list on his desk, and his
friends told the coroner at the time that he had seemed in good spirits. Turing’s
mother, in fact, maintained that he probably accidentally poisoned himself
while experimenting with the chemical in his home laboratory. (He was known
to taste chemicals while identifying them, and could be careless with safety precautions.)

That line of inquiry is far more tame than some others, including one author’s
theory that he was murdered by the FBI to cover up information that would have
been damaging to the U.S.
11. HIS FULL GENIUS WASN’T KNOWN IN HIS LIFETIME.
Alan Turing was a well-respected mathematician in his time, but his contemporaries
didn’t know the full extent of his contributions to the world. Turing’s work breaking
the Enigma machine remained classified long after his death, meaning that his
contributions to the war effort and to mathematics were only partially known to
the public during his lifetime. It wasn’t until the 1970s that his instrumental
role in the Allies' World War II victory became public with the declassification
of the Enigma story. The actual techniques Turing used to decrypt the messages
weren’t declassified until 2013, when two of his papers from Bletchley Park
were released to the British National Archives.

12. THE TURING TEST IS STILL USED TO MEASURE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE …
Can a machine fool a human into thinking they are chatting with another person?
That’s the crux of the Turing test, an idea developed by Turing in 1950
regarding how to measure artificial intelligence. Turing argued in his paper
“Computing Machinery and Intelligence” [PDF] that the idea of machines “thinking”
is not a useful way to evaluate artificial intelligence. Instead, Turing suggests
“the imitation game,” a way to assess how successfully a machine can imitate human
behavior. The best measure of artificial intelligence, then, is whether or not a
computer can convince a person that it is human.

13. … BUT SOME CONSIDER IT TO BE AN OUTDATED IDEA.
As technology has progressed, some feel the Turing test is no longer a useful way to
measure artificial intelligence. It’s cool to think about computers being able to talk
just like a person, but new technology is opening up avenues for computers to express
intelligence in other, more useful ways. A robot’s intelligence isn’t necessarily
defined by whether it can fake being human—self-driving cars or programs that can
mimic sounds based on images might not pass the Turing test, but they certainly have intelligence.

14. HE CREATED THE FIRST COMPUTER CHESS PROGRAM.
Inspired by the chess champions he worked with at Bletchley Park, Alan Turing
created an algorithm for an early version of computer chess—although at that time,
there was no computer to try it out on. Created with paper and pencil,
the Turochamp program was designed to think two moves ahead, picking out
the best moves possible. In 2012, Russian chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov
played against Turing’s algorithm, beating it in 16 moves. “I would compare
it to an early car—you might laugh at them but it is still an incredible achievement,"
Kasparov said in a statement after the match-up.

15. THERE IS ALAN TURING MONOPOLY.
In 2012, Monopoly came out with an Alan Turing edition to celebrate the centennial of his birth.
Turing had enjoyed playing Monopoly during his life,
and the Turing-themed Monopoly edition was designed based on a hand-drawn board created
in 1950 by his friend William Newman. Instead of hotels and houses, it featured huts and
blocks inspired by Bletchley Park, and included never-before-published photos of Turing.
(It’s hard to find, but there are still a few copies of the game on Amazon.)
