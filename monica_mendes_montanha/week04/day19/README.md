# World Currencies
This is a comprehensive project which I did to helps me to learn to use Ruby and SQLite3 to build interconnected webpages with dynamic content which can pass data between pages.

## CRUD
In computer programming, CRUD are the four basic functions of persistent storage.
* **C**reate: A new currency is entered into the database.
* **R**ead:  The new currency's information is displayed to the user or programmer.
* **U**pdate: Currency information, such as image of the currency and country of origin are added to the currency.
* **D**elete: If you aren't going to add any images or currency'name for this country, the country can be deleted. Or, the country is removed for other reasons (duplicate entry or lack of information).
