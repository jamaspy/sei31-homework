    <p>Hopper was born Grace Brewster Murray in New York City. She was the oldest in a family of three children. She was curious as a child, a lifelong trait; at the age of seven she decided to determine how an alarm clock worked, and dismantled seven alarm clocks before her mother realized what she was doing (she was then limited to one clock).</p>
    <p>In <strong>1934</strong>, she earned a Ph.D. in mathematics from Yale under the direction of Oystein Ore. Her dissertation, New Types of Irreducibility Criteria, was published that same year. Hopper began teaching mathematics at Vassar in 1931, and was promoted to associate professor in <strong>1941</strong>. She was married to New York University professor Vincent Foster Hopper <strong>(1906â€“76)</strong> from <strong>1930</strong> until their divorce in 1945. She never remarried, and she kept his surname.</p>
    <p>In <strong>1943</strong>, during World War II, Hopper obtained a leave of absence from Vassar and was sworn into the United States Navy Reserve, one of many women to volunteer to serve in the WAVES.</p>
