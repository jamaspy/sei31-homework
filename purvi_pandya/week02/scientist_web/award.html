        <h4>BUG</h4>
    <article>
    <p>When she was involved with testing the Mark II Aiken Relay Calculator at Harvard in 1947 the machine malfunctioned. Upon investigation the operators found a moth stuck at Relay #70, panel F. Using tweezers, the moth was removed and taped to the computer log with the explanatory text “First actual case of bug being found.” The story was put out that the computer had been debugged and the term “debugging” had been added to the computer world’s vocabulary. Hopper often said “From then on, when anything went wrong with a computer, we said it had bugs in it." The original logbook page, dated September 9 and with the moth still taped to it, is located in the Naval History Center at the U.S. Naval Surface Warfare Center in Dahlgren, Virginia.</p></<article>

      <h4>COBOL</h4>

    <article>
    <p>She once told the story that she had developed a French version of FLOW-MATIC where all the English words were replaced by French words. When she showed it to her bosses at UNIVAC, they were abhorred at the idea of a French-speaking computer and threw her out of the office. In the late fifties the demand for high-level programming languages became stronger. Especially the U.S. Department of Defense insisted on a common business oriented programming language. IBM had developed the COMTRAN (COMmercial TRANslator) compiler for this purpose, and Honeywell had developed a similar language, FACT. Hopper who brought in her FLOW-MATIC experience, realized that if one used full-length English words like READ or MULTIPLY in a structured and well-defined language, a compiler could be developed to translate these words in machine language. It signified the birth of COBOL – COmmon Business Oriented Language. It became the most-widely used high-level programming language of the 20th century </p></article>

      <h4>UNIVAC</h4>
    <article>
    <p>The UNIVAC (UNIversal Automatic Computer), the world’s first commercial electronic computer. n those early days of computing programmers had to write their programs in binary code – strings of 0’s and 1’s – as that was the only language understood by the computer. Hopper soon realized that it would help greatly if the computer had a routine to convert instructions into machine code. In 1952 she developed the world’s first compiler, the A-0, for that purpose. This was followed by the A-1 and A-2 in 1953. Although Hopper’s compilers were initially devised to place certain subroutines (e.g. for calculating sines, cosines or doing floating-point arithmetic) in a place in the computer’s memory, it opened up the way for compilers converting high-level language into machine language. It was a significant step forward in the development of the computer.</p></article>
